## Step 2 - Use @cycle/state

The goal is to refactor our app to use `@cycle/state`


Using this tool, we can express the different transformation of our app in a
very expressive way:

- increment the counter
- toggle the status of the app


Those operations are mapped to periodic signals or user interactions.
